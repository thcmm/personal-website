					<p id="rcorners6">My name is Thomas. I am a Boulder transplant of just over one year. I was born in a small New England town 50 miles north of Boston. While in my early 20's I had the opportunity to escape the clutches of the norm and moved to Sweden where I studied multimedia development, learned to make vodka and party like a viking. After 10 years of 7 month winters I returned to the states and worked as an independent consultant developing multimedia applications in Boston.<br>
					Within 1.5 years I decided to make yet another change in my life and headed for south east Asia to learn how to scuba dive. Shortly after I became intrigued with underwater video and began exploring the world of oceanic videography. Years later I put down the camera and began working with coral reef restoration and have been doing so ever since.<br>
				    A two month contract in Boulder turned into full-time employment with a small company manufacturing underwater camera systems here in town. While developing water quality telemetry peripherals for video camera systems I realized that functional user interfaces were best created using Full-Stack technologies, a skillset I was lacking. So - here I am and building hardware control and display interfaces is why I am studying at Galvanize.<br>
					
					In my spare time I enjoy learning about new advancements in technologies such as: Computing, Electronics, Micro-CPU platforms, Hardware&Software Development. 

					I also enjoy being outside and participate in activities including: Walking, Hiking, Biking, Diving, Swimming, Diving, Quadcopter's, Beer tasting, Music, and Cooking.
